### Features:
1. The steam idler works 24/7 (deployed on Heroku)
2. If your steam account is connected to mobile authenticator you have to enter a guard code in the chat <b>every 24h</b>
3. If your accounts connected to SDA you dont need to enter the guard code (use the `shared_secret`)
4. You can idle upto 32 games for each account (+ one custom game)
5. You can add as many steam accounts as you want (im not sure about any limits. I managed to add 25 accs)
6. <b>IMPORTANT:</b> Heroku restarts every 24h and it doesnt saves any actions from the chat (like `!add`, `!remove`, `!addgame`, etc), so you have to make all the needed configuration in the `config.json` before you run the  bot on Heroku,
7. <b>OR</b> you can use the github repo to save all changes from the chat permanently (needs to have a github account)



<b>Requirements:</b>
1. Install Git: https://git-scm.com/downloads
2. Install Heroku CLI: https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/heroku-cli
3. Register at https://heroku.com
4. Register a new steam account (it will be a bot), disable steam guard, add to friend this acc from your main
5. (Optional) Register a new Github account: https://github.com/

config.json example:
```
{
  "remote_control":true,
  "github_token":"AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA",
  "github_username":"gunthersuper",
  "username":"gunther_bot",
  "password":"touchmenowww", 
  "shared_secret":"",
  "main":"76561198261256059",
  "bot_playing":["time boost",730,570,440],
  "persona":"1",
  "users":[
    {"user":"gunthersuper","password":"pass12345","shared_secret":"","key":"","games":[570,440,730],"persona":1,"logged":true}
  ]
}
```
You can use more than one account to idle:
```
"users":[
    {"user":"gunthersuper","password":"pass12345","shared_secret":"","key":"","games":[570,440,730],"persona":1,"logged":true},
    {"user":"gunther2","password":"pass12345","shared_secret":"","key":"","games":[730],"persona":7,"logged":true},
    {"user":"gunther3r","password":"pass12345","shared_secret":"","key":"","games":[440,730],"persona":1,"logged":true}
  ]
```

**3.1. Github repo to save changes in the `config.json` permanently (`"remote_control":true`)**
- You started the idler on Heroku, then added more accs using the chat coomands (`!add username password`), but Heroku restarts every 24h and doesnt save any changes in the config so you lose this changes, and you have to add this accs to the `config.json` before the deploying. And if you want to add more accs after you deployed the idler, you need to stop it, add accs to the config, then enter: `git add config.json`, `git commit -m "commit"`, `git push heroku main`, `heroku ps:scale web=0`, `heroku ps:scale bot=1`
- But you can fix that problem:
  - Register a Github account if you havent one.
  - Go to: settings -> Developer settings -> Personal access tokens -> Generate new token ![img](https://i.imgur.com/pHHz5gg.png)
  - Enter some note, click Generate new token. Copy this token and paste to the `config.json` to the `"github_token"` parameter.
  - Enter your github username to the `config.json` to the `"github_username"` parameter.
  - Make a new repository. ![img](https://i.imgur.com/O21QNdz.png) 
  - Name it json. **Make it private**  
![img](https://i.imgur.com/We01KvV.png)
  - Upload the `config.json` to the created repository, click on _uploading an existing files_
![img](https://i.imgur.com/VjvtkXa.png)
  - Select your config file, and click _commit changes_

  - So you will get this repo:

- If you dont want to add/remove accs, set games to idle or set status of your accs in the chat with the bot you can just make this:
```
  "remote_control":false,
  "github_token":"AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA",
  "github_username":"",
```

4. **Deploying:** Open the console in the same folder (SHIFT + right mouse, open PowerShell window here, if you use Windows), enter the next commands:
    - `git add .`
    - `git commit -m 'commit'`
    - `heroku login`
Then login in your browser
    - `heroku create`
    - `git push heroku main`
    - `heroku ps:scale web=0`
    - `heroku ps:scale bot=1`


5. Then it will try to login to the accs in the config. If you need to enter a guard code you will receive a message about it. Enter the guard code in the chat.
6. To stop the idler enter: `heroku ps:scale bot=0`
7. To start it again: `heroku ps:scale bot=1`
